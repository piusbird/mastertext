# PRIVACY WARNING!

Using this system for it's primary use case will cause your text to 
speech system to hooked into a full text searchable database.
While this provides functionality to learning disabled and blind people
that is designed to let us keep up with our peers. And is exciting
and fun besides. The author feels the need to remind himself and potential
future users of this software of one thing.

**Everything you READ is stored, until you delete it**

Keep your database *safe* ideally this means on an encrypted file system
of some sort. 

That's the big letters scary warning, out of the way. The author also 
would like to take a moment give you a few other safety warnings 
and tips, that apply particularly to the web front end.

Keep in mind that the default view of a document, is not the original 
format of that document, it is passed through a markdown parser.
Although this is designed to give maximum flexibility when annotating 
things. It does mean that anything passed to the speech system from
the web ui will be assigned a different reference id, and hence a 
copy will exist. Please be sure to delete all copies of something
sensitive.

An easy way to do this is planned for the first alpha release
but you are using pre alpha software so you assume the risk.

For the love of G-D don't let anyone shoulder surf while you are 
using this. Private Browsing is your friend in this case

Finally this document may change at any time as new privacy 
concerns are discovered and/or mitigated so please check back
regularly.
